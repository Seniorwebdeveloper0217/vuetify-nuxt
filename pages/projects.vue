      <p>CASE STUDY</p>
      <p class="bluetitle">POWER CONFIGURATION FOR CHARGEPOINT CHARGERS IN CONDOMINIUMS</p>
      <br>
      <p class="bluetitle">BACKGROUND</p>
      <p>The customer wants to install 150 charging stations between 2 different buildings. The original premise was that each parking spot would have its own single port charging station with maximum amperage at all times.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="bluetitle">THE PROBLEM</p>
      <p>With each charging station, additional wattage must be set aside for your connection. This extra connection requires a deposit to be made to the power companies and will greatly increase the cost of electrical infrastructure in the building. In order to maximize the amount of profit the developer/property owner can make then the charger configuration must be optimized to provide the best connection for drivers while reducing connection requirements.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="bluetitle">THE SOLUTION</p>
      <p>We will use smart controlled distribution to reduce connected amperage while still allowing maximum charging capability when sites are not fully occupied. This will reduce the amount of connection required at the panel level and thus, reduce the expenses incurred by infrastructure. </p>

        <p class="bluetitle">THE VARIOUS CONFIGURATIONS</p>
        <p>ChargePoint Level II Chargers allow for a variety of power ratings. Through these configurations and intelligent power sharing, we hope to show how you can save money on the installation while still providing adequate service for electric vehicle owners.</p>
        <p>The chargers priced out in this case study are CPF25 – Bollard mounted, Multifamily units. Each of these configurations comes with their own expenses & deposits that are listed below. Each charging station is priced out both with and without cable management ystems. These systems are highly recommended as they help prevent excess cord resting on the floor of parking garage. See local ESA requirements to understand if this is necessary.</p>
        <p>All prices are accurate as of September 7, 2018.</p>

        <p class="bluetitle">32 AMPS PER PARKING SPOT – SINGLE STATIONS</p>
        <p>First we will look at the option that charges cars the fastest, but is the most expensive. In this configuration, each EV Parking spot will have a dedicated 32A charging station. For the two buildings that will mean they will have to add an electrical panel that can provide 3400A and 3000A for the 85 charger building and 75 charger building respectively.</p>

        <p>These chargers allow the end users to charge their car fully in as little as 3 hours providing 7.7kW at peak power (32 Amps, 240 Volts though 208V is conventional for larger buildings). ChargePoint chargers allow for 32A through single port stations or 32A through both ports of dual port stations. Each port would therefore need its own 40A breaker further adding to the cost. Assuming that they are all installed in one central location with appropriate connections, disregarding the cost to run conduit to each station, we get the following costs associated with this configuration:</p>

        <p>32A single port charging stations (without Cable management):</p>	<p class="rightjust">$2,492.25 each, $373,837.50 total</p>
        <p>32A single port charging stations (with Cable management):</p> <p class="rightjust">$3,714.65 each, $557,197.50 total</p>
        <p>3200A Panel :</p> <p class="rightjust">$</p>

        <p class="bluetitle">32 AMPS PER PARKING SPOT – DUAL STATIONS</p>
        <p>Another option is to use dual-port stations to reduce hardware costs. While this configuration does not save the developer any amount of money through their connection deposit, it does allow them to lower the amount of charging station hardware that is purchased while covering the same number of spots.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="bold">Without Cable Management</p>
        <p>32A single port charging stations:</p>	<p class="rightjust">$2,492.25 each, $373,837.50 total</p>
        <p>Price per parking spot:</p> <p class="rightjust">$2,492.25</p>
        <br>
        <p>32A dual port charging stations:</p>	<p class="rightjust">$4,361.45 each, $327,108.75 total</p>
        <p>Price per parking spot:</p>				<p class="rightjust">$2,180.73</p>

        <p class="bold">With Cable Management</p>
        <p>32A single port charging stations:</p>	<p class="rightjust">$3,714.65 each, $557,197.50 total</p>
        <p>Price per parking spot:</p> <p class="rightjust">$3,714.65</p>
        <br>
        <p>32A dual port charging stations:</p>	<p class="rightjust">$5,524.50 each, $414,337.50 total</p>
        <p>Price per parking spot:</p> <p class="rightjust">$2,762.25</p>
        <br>
        <p>As you can see, per parking spot the 32A dual port charging stations are much cheaper per parking spot and will save the customer money.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="bluetitle">POWER SHARING CONFIGURATION - 16 AMPS PER PARKING SPOT</p>
        <p>ChargePoint chargers use intelligent power sharing technology to allow the station owner to manage the amount of power they can consume. Using both software and hardware, a system of selected stations can share power based on the needs of the vehicle being charged and the size of the panel/allotted power.
        <br>
        <p>The key benefit of intelligent power sharing is that it can decrease the panel sizes and connection requirement. Due to the large load of the previous two options, the panel sizes are large, expensive and will use more electricity which will have an impact on your electricity bill. Furthermore, the higher amperage options may require a larger deposit to be made to your power utility provider. For further information regarding deposits, make sure to contact your utility provider.</p>
        <br>
        <p>With the maximum current configuration, we found that the larger panels and breakers cost the following:</p>
        <br>
        <p>3200A Panel and associated breakers:</p>	<p class="rightjust">$38,000.00</p>
        <br>
        <p>But by using power sharing to provide power in a 2-1 configuration (One 40 amp breaker for each dual port station), we can shrink the panel size by a half, saving the developer $14,000.</p>
        <br>
        <p>1600A Panel and associated breakers:</p>	<p class="rightjust">$24,000.00</p>
        <br>
        <p>We can, however go even further. By enabling power sharing in a 4-1 configuration, we can effectively reduce the panel size by 4x. This limits the amount of power provided to each station when all cars are plugged in. Through this, we can reduce the cost greatly as we can get the panelsize down to 800 Amps.</p>
        <br>
        <p>800A Panel and associated breakers:</p> <p class="rightjust">$8,500.00</p>
        <br>
        <p>One concern that you may have is that the power sharing will increase the time required for an electric vehicle to charge if all charging stations are in use. The ChargePoint software, however, ensures that each charging station only gets however much power that it needs. For example, if a car is plugged in to a 32 Amp station and is completely charged, it will get very little current from the charging station and another vehicle that is charged into the other port of the same station will get the vast majority of available power.</p>
        <br>
        <p>With ChargePoint’s dynamic power sharing, each car is given the ideal current given the available current. And if the charge time is increased due to large load, a user with the ChargePoint app will be notified so that they are always aware of their car’s battery charge. And when a car is charging overnight, it is often charging for 8 hours at a time, which is more than enough time for standard electric vehicle to charge before the next morning.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The station cost remains the same as the 32 Amp model with the only difference being the settings used.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="bluetitle"AN IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT CHARGEPOINT CHARGING STATIONS</p>
          <p>ChargePoint charging stations are state of the art electric vehicle equipment and one of their key features is their cloud data plan. This plan allows the owner of these stations to access station information and adjust settings anywhere at any time which will reduce metering at the payment costs. In order to do this, up to 8 different stations must be connected to a gateway unit. To be connected to a gateway unit, a station must be within 45 feet and within line of sight. Furthermore, the gateway unit must have adequate cellular connection to connect to the cloud server.</p>
        <br>
      <p>When designing the layout for these stations, ensure that there enough gateway units to connect each station adequately. It is recommended that charging stations are installed close to each other to provide easier connection and reduce the amount of conduit needed to reach each station.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="bluetitle">RESIDENTIAL UNITS</p>
      <p>It may be tempting to use residential units as they are cheaper than the CPF25 units. However, there are several problems with these units for condominium purposes that keep them from being a valid solution. The first and most important of which is the lack of access controls. Without the access controls that come with the CPF25 units, anyone with access to the parking garage can charge their electric vehicle, even if they did not pay for the parking spot.</p>

        <p class="bluetitle">CONCLUSION</p>
        <p>While there are many different possibilities, we believe that the power sharing configuration – 16 amps per parking spot using CPF25 – dual port multifamily models are ideal for this situation. They have access controls, preventing other electric car users from stealing their parking spots or charging stations, as well as the ability to reduce the infrastructure costs</p>
